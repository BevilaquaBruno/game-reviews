The Apology of Socrates is a great book for those who want to get started with philosophy, because it brings reflections and points that are simple to understand, Socrates' own speech according to himself in the transcript of his speech, is simple and easy to understand.

The book deals with Socrates' defense speech, whose accusations are of not believing in the Olympian gods and of corrupting youth.

As well as questioning and arguing against his accusations in different ways, giving examples from his life and using simple premises to set up arguments, Socrates ends up asking whether death, which is the punishment he has received, is in fact a punishment and not a good thing.
